            <h3>Lincolnshire Martial Arts Website</h3>
            <p>I was comissioned to build a website for the several Tang Soo Do clubs across Lincoln. I was really excited to take part in this project, as Martial Arts is something I've recently gotten involved with since starting university, and it was great to be able to combine that for my new-found skills in website development. This was a large project - larger than any I completed during my first year of university, so at times it felt overwhelming to approach. But it was an excellent opportunity and I learned so much in the process.</p>

            <p><i>"Consolidate, Secure, Educate"</i></p>
            <p>One of my first year modules involved an industry project. We were visited by two companies, and selected a brief among us. We created a holistic security solution for an energy company, including information on data storage and staff training. I collaborated with my peers for 3 months on this project, at the end of which we presented our solution to the company. I had never done anything like an industry presentation before, so while this was a nerve-wracking experience, I was really grateful for the opportunity to expand my skills.</p>

            <h3 id="top-gap">Personal website</h3>
            <p><i>The website you're reading now!</i></p>
            <p>This website was a project I set myself. I surprised myself with how much I enjoyed full stack development in my first year studies, and so I wanted to challenge myself to make another website where I was not only the developer, but the client! It has been so enlightening to plan a project from scratch and see it to completion. Every choice from content to style has been mine, and I think this site really reflects not only my technical abilities, but my personal style and personality.</p>
