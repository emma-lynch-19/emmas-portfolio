                    <p>CyberSips hosted an excellent all-female panel of cybersecurity professionals off the back of international women's day.

She spoke about her journey in cyber, how she came to it after working in the banking sector, and how she got to where she is today.

                    <p>We had geust speaker Stu Aiken attend the university to deliver a workshop on using Microsoft Sentinel. He led an engaging talk on similar software used in the industry, the unique qualities of sentinel, and a live demo of how to use it. It was fantastic to put a technical understanding of threat detection to a practical tool used in most businesses.</p>

                    <p>Northumbria University hosted an excellent session with the North East Business Resillience Centre. It was an opportunity to learn all about the current state of the industry, and how to set yourself apart from similar applicants with extra qualifications (some of which I have since completed!). I particularly enjoyed hearing from Martin Wilson, who works for Northumbria Police, and who I spoke with after the event.</p>
